LGMPAS: LLM-Guided Machine Pseudo-Absences for Species Distribution Modelling

This repository contains the code and data-processing scripts for the paper:
“LLM-guided pseudo-absence generation for freshwater crayfish in network-constrained habitats”

The LGMPAS framework integrates environmental predictors, network topology, and natural-language eco-narratives to generate ecologically realistic pseudo-absences using large language models (LLMs). It is designed for freshwater river networks but is generalizable to other spatially structured systems.
